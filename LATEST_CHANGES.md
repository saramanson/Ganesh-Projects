# ✅ New Features Added

I have implemented the requested changes!

## 1. New "Fully Paid" Split Option
You can now assign the **entire expense to one person**.

*   **How to use**:
    1.  In the "Add Expense" form, go to the second dropdown (Split Type).
    2.  Select **"Fully Paid (Full Amount)"**.
    3.  A new dropdown will appear asking **"Full amount allocated to:"**.
    4.  Select the person who is responsible for the full amount.

## 2. Default "Who Paid?" Selection
The system now automatically selects **YOU** as the payer by default.

*   **How it works**:
    *   When you open the "Add Expense" form, it checks if your username matches any member in the group.
    *   If a match is found, **your name is automatically selected** in the "Who paid?" field.
    *   *Note: This relies on your "Friend" name matching your login username (`Ganesh`).*
