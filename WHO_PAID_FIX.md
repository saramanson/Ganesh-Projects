# ⚠️ Troubleshooting: "Who Paid" Auto-Selection

If the "Who Paid" field is **still not defaulting to your name**, please check the following:

## 1. Are you in the Friends List?
The app separates "Login Users" from "Friends".
*   You must add **yourself** as a friend in the sidebar.
*   **Name**: Must match your username (e.g., "Ganesh") (Case-insensitive).

## 2. Are you in the Group?
*   Just being logged in doesn't make you a member of every group.
*   **Action**: Select the group "Home 2026", click **"+ Add Member"**, and add yourself ("Ganesh") to the group.

## 3. How it works
When you open "Add Expense":
1.  The app looks at your login name ("Ganesh").
2.  It looks for a **Friend** with that same name.
3.  It checks if that Friend is a **member of the current group**.
4.  If yes, it selects that friend as the payer.

**Try this:**
1.  Go to **Friends** sidebar → Click `+` → Add "Ganesh".
2.  Go to **Groups** sidebar → Select "Home 2026".
3.  Click `+ Add Member` → Select "Ganesh".
4.  Now click `Add Expense`.
5.  "Who Paid" should now say "Ganesh"!
