# ✅ Feature Update: Auto-Date

I have updated the application to ensuring dates are always handled correctly for your timezone.

## 📅 Changes
1.  **Personal Expenses**: The date now defaults to **Today** (based on your computer's local clock) instead of being empty.
2.  **Group Expenses**: I added a **Date Picker** to the "Add Expense" form, which also defaults to **Today**.
3.  **Reset Logic**: When you add an expense, the form resets the date to Today automatically, ready for the next entry.

## 🔄 To View Changes
Please **Refresh your browser** to load the new form logic.
