# ✅ Fixed: "Who Paid" Self Selection

I have manually synchronized your account with the expense groups.

## What was done:
1.  **Checked your account**: Found user `Ganesh`.
2.  **Checked friends list**: Verified `Ganesh` exists as a friend.
3.  **Checked groups**: Found group `HOME EXPENSE 2026` (Note: name was slightly different from "Home 2026").
4.  **Action**: Added `Ganesh` to `HOME EXPENSE 2026`.

## 🚀 Result
*   You are now a member of **all existing groups**.
*   **"Who Paid"** will now default to **Ganesh**.
*   You can select yourself for full payments.

## 🔄 Final Step
**Refresh your browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R) to reload the fresh data.
