# ✅ Fixes & UI Updates

I have addressed your requests!

## 1. 🐛 Fix: Personal Expenses Not Saving
I improved the processing of expense data.
*   **Issue**: Entering amounts with symbols (like `$`) or formatting issues prevented saving.
*   **Fix**: The app now automatically removes `$` and `,` from amounts before saving.
*   **Bonus**: Added specific error alerts so you know if something goes wrong.

## 2. 🎨 UI Updates: Compact Icons
I've shortened the tabs and buttons to use **Icons** with tooltips (hover to see description).

| Old Text | New Icon | Tooltip (Hover) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Expense Tracker | 💰 Tracker | Expense Tracker |
| Split Expenses | 👥 Split | Split Expenses |
| Add Member | +👤 | Add Member |
| Expenses (Tab) | 💸 | Expenses |
| Balances (Tab) | ⚖️ | Balances |
| Settlements (Tab) | 🤝 | Settlements |
| Add Transaction | + | Add Expense |
